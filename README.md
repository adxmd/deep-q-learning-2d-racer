# Racing a Car using Deep Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch

Implements Q-Learning with a Convolution Neural Network to create a Deep Q-Learning RL Agent that is able to be trained to complete laps on a 2D racetrack from OpenAI's Gymnasium.

## To run this:

**Install Dependencies**

`pip -r install requirements.txt`

**Testing** 

***Currently trying to figure out how to upload pre-trained models to repo***
